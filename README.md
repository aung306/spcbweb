Hi developers! Your first step is creating a branch of this repository. Please denote using your initials and what you are working on. For example, 'au-config'.

Your next step is to ```git clone``` this repository from the main branch. Then, follow the instructions below to get started on developing our website!

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
